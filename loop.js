// loop- it means repeat something again and again
// while loop --- i need to write breaking condition for the while loop, otherwise it will run for the whole life. 100 is th ebreaking point, so it will run for the 100 TimeRanges.

var i = 1;

while(i <= 10){
    console.log('um sorry', i)
    i++
}

// for loop---- it is same as while loop, but for the for loop i need to write a normal variable

for(var x = 1; x <=10; x++){
    console.log('um sorry', x)
}
